    "This project will take you through the process of implementing a simplified version of the game Wheel of Fortune. Here are the rules of our game:\n",
    "\n",
    "   * There are num_human human players and num_computer computer players.\n",
    "\n",
    "   *        Every player has some amount of money ($0 at the start of the game)\n",
    "\n",
    "   *         Every player has a set of prizes (none at the start of the game)\n",
    "\n",
    "   * The goal is to guess a phrase within a category. For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "           * Category: Artist & Song\n",
    "\n",
    "           * Phrase: Whitney Houston’s I Will Always Love You\n",
    "\n",
    "  *  Players see the category and an obscured version of the phrase where every alphanumeric character in the phrase starts out as hidden (using underscores: _):\n",
    "\n",
    "         *   Category: Artist & Song\n",
    "\n",

    "  *  During their turn, every player spins the wheel to determine a prize amount and:\n",

    "          *  If the wheel lands on a cash square, players may do one of three actions:\n",

    "\n",
    "                          *  The player can guess any letter that hasn’t been guessed and gets that cash amount for every time that letter appears in the phrase\n",

    "\n",
    "                  *  Guess the complete phrase by typing a phrase (anything over one character that isn’t ‘pass’)\n",
    "\n",
    "                         *   If they are correct, they win the game\n",
