    "At this point, you should be able to look at complete functions and tell what they do. Also, if you have been doing the exercises, you have written some small functions. As you write larger functions, you might start to have more difficulty, especially with runtime and semantic errors.\n",
    "\n",
    "To deal with increasingly complex programs, we are going to suggest a technique called incremental development. The goal of incremental development is to avoid long debugging sessions by adding and testing only a small amount of code at a time.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you write unit tests before doing the incremental development, you will be able to track your progress as the code passes more and more of the tests. Alternatively, you can write additional tests at each stage of incremental development.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Then you will be able to check whether any code change you make at a later stage of development causes one of the earlier tests, which used to pass, to not pass any more.\n",

    "\n",
    "The first step is to consider what a distance function should look like in Python. In other words, what are the inputs (parameters) and what is the output (return value)?\n",
    "\n",
    "In this case, the two points are the inputs, which we can represent using four parameters. The return value is the distance, which is a floating-point value.\n",
    "\n",
    "Already we can write an outline of the function that captures our thinking so far.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Obviously, this version of the function doesn’t compute distances; it always returns None. But it is syntactically correct, and it will run, which means that we can test it before we make it more complicated.\n",
    "\n",
    "The distance between any point and itself should be 0."
